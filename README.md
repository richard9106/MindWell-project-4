## Testing
</span>
I used Google Chrome web developer tools and Responsively app for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

[<span style="color:orange">Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) was very helpful the diferent screen sizes are listed below:

### Cell phones

- Galaxy S5 (360 - 640)
- Nokia N9 (480px - 854px)

### Tablets

- Ipad (768px - 1024px)
- Ipad Pro (1024 -1366)

### Desck top

- Nest Hub (1024px - 600px)
- Macbook Pro (1440px - 900px)

<span style="color:Orange;"> 

## Performance testing
</span>

I run [<span style="color:orange">Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![bug_performance1](./static/images/readme_images/lighthouse2.png)


I noticed that the scores of these tests change from time to time and also depend on external libraries.

I had some issues with bootstrap cdn loading time and some background images in the css, they are compressed but it's not improving the performance

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [<span style="color:orange">W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmindwellproject4-c451517df623.herokuapp.com%2F)

- CSS
  - 17  errors were found when passing through the official [<span style="color:orange">(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmindwellproject4-c451517df623.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=es)
  this errors are because Bootstrap cdn so there is nothing that i can do, but if I give to de css validator my css files everything it's pass.

![error css validator](./static/images/readme_images/ccvalidator.png)

## Validator Testing
* PEP8
    - All clear, no errors found, I passed all models and forms


## Other Test

 * Every application has some unit test to verify that the forms are working correctly. 

###  Bugs (all the bugs are fixed)

* When we send forms the messages to display stay visibles in other pages if you are logIn  <span style="color:red"> NO-FIXED </span>

* When the user try to edit their info it's no showing the last info, so the user have to add all the info again <span style="color:green"> FIXED </span>


<span style="color:Orange;"> 

# Deployment
</span>
The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used VsCode as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system.
I used push command in VsCode save changes into GitHub /Heroku.

<br>
Since Github does not support Python, the deployment of the app, the website is made by Heroku

To deploy a project I had to:

* Log in to Heroku, create a new app, add the Config Vars, and connect trought GitHUb.
* Choose the right repository and click deploy button.
>  Your site is published at https://mindwellproject4-c451517df623.herokuapp.com/

* Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy ([<span style="color:orange">MindWell-project-4](https://github.com/richard9106/MindWell-project-4))
* select `Settings` and find GitHub Pages section at the very bottom of the page
* from source select `none` and then `Milestone-Projects` branch.

### To run localy:
 
* Log in to VScode account and link your repository to be open with VScode.

* Creating a virtual space in gitHub https://github.com/richard9106/MindWell-project-4 open the repository and then click on CODE green buttom and create a virtual space.

* once it has been created you can open it with VScode directly from your virtual space, you have to install  the requirements.txt using the command 

> pip install -r requirements.txt

* Last thing add <span style="color:orange;"> env.py </span>  with the missing variables for the settings like in this case Cloudinary and ElephantSql data base info (User, Key, Apikey, etc.)
