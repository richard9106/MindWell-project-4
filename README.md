<span style="color:Orange;"> 

## Performance testing
</span>

I run [<span style="color:orange">Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![bug_performance1](./static/images/readme_images/lighthouse2.png)


I noticed that the scores of these tests change from time to time and also depend on external libraries.

I had some issues with bootstrap cdn loading time and some background images in the css, they are compressed but it's not improving the performance

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [<span style="color:orange">W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmindwellproject4-c451517df623.herokuapp.com%2F)

- CSS
  - 17  errors were found when passing through the official [<span style="color:orange">(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmindwellproject4-c451517df623.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=es)
  this errors are because Bootstrap cdn so there is nothing that i can do, but if I give to de css validator my css files everything it's pass.

![error css validator](./static/images/readme_images/ccvalidator.png)

## Validator Testing
* PEP8
    - All clear, no errors found, I passed all models and forms


## Other Test

 * Every application has some unit test to verify that the forms are working correctly. 

## How to Run Tests

To run tests in the Django project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed with the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Set up the necessary environment variables for your testing environment. If needed, add an `env.py` file with the specific configurations.

3. Run the tests using the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py test
    ```

4. If you want to check test coverage, install `coverage`:
    ```bash
    pip install coverage
    ```

   Then run the tests with coverage and generate the report:
    ```bash
    coverage run manage.py test
    coverage report
    ```

5. Optionally, check code style compliance using `flake8`:
    ```bash
    pip install flake8
    flake8
    ```

If you encounter issues while running the tests, make sure that migrations are applied correctly and all dependencies are up to date.


###  Bugs (all the bugs are fixed)

* When we send forms the messages to display stay visibles in other pages if you are logIn  <span style="color:red"> NO-FIXED </span>

* When the user try to edit their info it's no showing the last info, so the user have to add all the info again <span style="color:green"> FIXED </span>

# Deployment


  for a deployment, keep in mind that depending on the functionalities, some extra configuration may be missing. Very important is the configuration of variables in Heroku and the add-ons since without these activated you will not be able to see the project correctly

  Initially, Django was installed following this Code Institute [DRF Cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCLxWhmW_4VTE4GXsnHgmPUwSPKNT4KyMxSH8agbVqU/edit#heading=h.mpopj7v69qqn)

   1. Create a Cloudinary account and gather API key
   2. Create ElephantSQL database and gather API key
   3. Install Django
   4. Create project
   5. Install Cloudinary Storage
   6. Install Pillow (image processing)
   7. Update INSTALLED_APPs
       * all apps in the django project must be make migrations
       * python manage.py makemigrations
       * python manage.py migrate
       * to pass external data to the models if you need it.
          - create the fixture folder
          - add your file.json to the folder
          - python manage.py loaddata 'name.json' 
   8. Create env.py file
       * Add CLOUDINARY_KEY (from Cloudinary API key)
       * Add SECRET_KEY - (a unique password)
       * ADD DATABASE_URL - (postgres ElephantSQL API key)
       * DEBUG = True (if you have to push to heroku set False)
   9. Update settings.py
       * CLOUDINARY_STORAGE
       * Define Media Storage URL
       * Set DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
       * Set DATABASES
    
    

  ### Deployment to Heroku involved the following steps and changes:
   1. Set up DEBUG in settins.py to False
   2. install gunicorn ==22.0.0
   3. Create a Procfile (web: gunicorn core.wsgi:application) 
   4. Create a runtime.txt file and add the following: Python-3.12.3
   5. Terminate all servers.
       * Ensure DEBUG and DEV in env.py are commented out
       * python3 manage.py runserver
   6. Check project is displaying in the preview on port 8000 or gitpod
   7. Log into your Heroku account, create a new app, and access the dashboard for your application
   8. Go to Settings and open the Config Vars add all the Api keys in your env.py
       * Add CLOUDINARY_KEY (the Cloudinary API key)
       * Add SECRET_KEY - (the unique password)
       * Add DATABASE_URL - (postgres ElephantSQL API key)
   9. Ensure your application has an ALLOWED_HOST your '.herokuapp.com' - '.gitpod.io'
   10. Ensure in Resources in heroku dasboard change your dinos active.
   11. Go to the Deploy tab, connect the project to GitHub, and choose main branch to deploy
       * Click Deploy Branch (manually)
       * (Optional) Select Enable Automatic Deploys

## FORKING AND CLONING INSTRUCTIONS
You can create a copy of a GitHub Repository without affecting the original by forking or cloning it.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to forking:
Forking is often used for proposing changes or using the project as a starting point for your own idea. Forking will apear on your GitHub profile.
1. Log into GitHub or sign up for an account.
2. Go to the [Mind Well Repository](https://github.com/richard9106/MindWell-project-4)
3. Click "Fork" on the right side of the repository's page to create a copy in your own repository.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to cloning:
Cloning is often used for experimenting locally.  It will not show up on your GitHub profile.
1. Go to the [Mind Well Repository](https://github.com/richard9106/MindWell-project-4)
2. Click the green code button, then the arrow, and select the "clone by https" option to copy the URL.
3. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Type 'git clone', paste the copied URL, and press enter. The repository will then be cloned to your machine.

## SECURITY SETTINGS
The following precautions were taken regarding the security of the site:
1. An env.py was created at the start of the project, and added to .gitignore, to contain the following settings:
   - CLOUDINARY_URL
   - SECRET_KEY
   - DATABASE_URL
2. These values were added to the Config Vars section of Heroku's Settings page.
3. Heroku is configured with 2FA


## Agile Workflow and User Story Prioritization

Our project follows an agile methodology using [Agile Tool Name] to manage and prioritize user stories. We categorize stories into high, medium, and low priority based on user needs and business goals.

### Prioritization Process
- **High priority** stories, such as critical features, are implemented first within each sprint.
- **Medium priority** stories include enhancements and secondary features.
- **Low priority** stories are nice-to-have features and are implemented after core functionality.

Each user story includes:
- A clear description of the feature.
- Criteria of acceptance to ensure successful implementation.
- Estimations of the effort required for completion.

 Go to the [Mind Well Repository project user stories](https://github.com/users/richard9106/projects/8/views/1?layout=table&visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Labels%22%5D)

### Sprint Planning and Execution
During each sprint, high-priority user stories are selected and tracked using [Agile Tool Name]. We use labels and color-coding to indicate the priority level and current status of each task (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").

Regular retrospectives help us ensure continuous improvement in both implementation and prioritization.
